This is a PDF scraper for politician's entitlements. Ideally, this would get all expenses from the PDF into appropriately named columns, but at the moment it is column agnostic and needs to be directed at a sub-section (eg. charter flights in this example). It'd be tops if someone has time to fix this to make it better!
